# Assets and Media

This folder contains website assets including GIFs and other media files from the KisanIndustries website.

## Folder Structure

- `gifs/` - Animated GIF files from the website
- `images/` - Static images (logos, banners, etc.)
- `videos/` - Video files if any

## How to Populate These Folders

Since the website assets are included in the All-in-One WP Migration backup, these folders serve as additional storage for:

1. **Reference assets** - Original files used during development
2. **Backup copies** - Duplicate copies of important media
3. **Optimized versions** - Compressed or optimized versions of assets

## GIFs Folder

The `gifs/` folder should contain animated GIFs found on the KisanIndustries website. These might include:

- Product demonstrations
- Animation loops
- Loading animations
- Interactive elements
- Banner animations

## Usage

These assets can be referenced in your local development and serve as:
- Reference for design consistency
- Backup copies of media files
- Source files for optimization
- Documentation of visual elements used on the site

## Note

The actual media files from the live site will be imported automatically when you restore the All-in-One WP Migration backup. These folders provide additional organization and backup options.
